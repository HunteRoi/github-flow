## Disclaimer

I have downloaded the content of the now-removed GitHub flow page from the WayBack Machine for educational purpose.
I don't maintain anything and I don't own anything.

## Changes made

- I updated [octicons.css font-face](./components/primer/octicons.css) to reference the local [octicons.woff file](./components/primer/octicons.woff).
- I changed the old header from the [index.html page](./index.html) to a custom disclaimer and also updated all references to local files.
- I removed some styles from [main.css](./stylesheets/main.css) such as the header stylings and the margin-top from the `article-heading` class.
- I added my own [disclaimer.css file](./stylesheets/disclaimer.css).
